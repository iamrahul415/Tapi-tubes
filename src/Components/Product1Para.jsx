          We manufacture a wide range of ERW Black Tubes, available in sizes
          from 15 NB to 150 NB and thicknesses between 1.2 mm to 6 mm. Produced
          from premium in-house HR coils, our tubes undergo the ERW welding
          process, ensuring strong, seamless joints that deliver exceptional
          structural integrity and safety. This precision-driven process allows
          us to cater to the construction, infrastructure, automotive,
          agriculture, and general engineering sectors with confidence.

          of the production process in-house, we maintain strict quality control
          and ensure uniformity in size, thickness, and finish across all
          products. Our advanced manufacturing facilities are equipped to handle
          bulk production volumes without compromising on quality, allowing us
          to serve both small-scale fabricators and large industrial projects
          with equal reliability.
